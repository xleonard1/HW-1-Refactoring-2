# HW-1-Refactoring-2

HTML: 

Updated html elements from divs to semantic elements such as main, headers, footers, and menu's. Got rid of unnecessary elements and sections. Added comments to describe the function of sections, and added alt tags for screen readers. Ensured that links led to the correct id. Heading attributes fall in sequential order when viewing, and title is descriptive. 

CSS:

Added comments in the css  file to ensure describe functionality and impact on HTML file and browser. Reduced redundancies in the selectors. Deleted unnecessary class selectors. Got rid of repeating attributes.
